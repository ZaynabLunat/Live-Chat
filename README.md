# Live Chat is a web application that demonstrates the use of web sockets, allowing real-time chat functionality and displaying a live user count

https://web-socket-pi.vercel.app/

## This app was built as part of a group project aimed at researching, understanding, and deploying web sockets in action. It was developed using a vanilla monorepo setup with Vite and deployed on Vercel. The "About" page contains links to the documentation and resources that were instrumental in the development process.

Challenges and Solutions 

One challenge we encountered was deploying a Vite project with multiple pages on Vercel. After trying several debugging solutions, such as placing the about.html file in a folder and modifying the file paths, we found the solution through the Vite documentation. The resource, "Vite Production Build", helped us resolve the issue, and we successfully deployed the project on Vercel.
